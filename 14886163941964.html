<p>Ashwyn Sharma:</p>

<p><strong>Do not apply for GSoC if you are not an Open Source Enthusiast!</strong></p>

<p>Crucial steps involved in the process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with the list of accepted organisations in the past years and pick one of them.</li>
<li>Contact the organisation telling them about yourself (in most cases - that you are a software developer who is new to their products/applications/platforms etc.) and how you wish to contribute to their codebase.</li>
<li>Get yourself familiar with the codebase. A little perseverance at this stage may prove decisive of your future with both GSoC and Open Source in general. Pick up a simple bug/feature-request from the bug tracker of the given application and try to solve it. Not only this will increase your chances of acceptance dramatically, it will also help you get familiar with the developers and of course, the code itself. An important thing to remember is to make your presence felt amongst the developer community. This will help you at later stages of the application process.</li>
<li>Provided you manage to solve the bug or develop that feature, the next step will be to commit your code to the Trunk/Central Repository.</li>
<li>Next is the application period. As soon as Google announces the list of the accepted organisations, start looking for the prospective <strong>project ideas</strong>. Think over how you can go about executing these ideas. Talk to the prospective mentors about what you think of the idea and may be fetch more details about the ins and outs of project. Though Google allows you to submit your own original ideas as well, I have always believed that its better to choose from the list of the ideas provided by the organization. However, if the idea is truly meaningful and has a feasible implementation plan, there have been instances where original ideas have been accepted as well. If you haven&#39;t already, keep working on that bug and solve it, because if you haven&#39;t really proved your coding skills to the organisation yet, then  your chances of getting accepted gets even simmer, no matter how strong your application maybe.</li>
<li>Start writing the proposal as early as possible. Make sure that before submitting the proposal, you get your proposal reviewed by your mentors as much as possible. The main ingredients of a good proposal are that it should address two kinds of audiences - one which is completely familiar with the technical details of the project (that would be your mentors and organisation devs) and the second one is a neutral not-so-technical audience which is able to understand the deliverables of the project (in most cases that would be the user base). Start coding up your idea.</li>
</ol>
